**Abstract**

> Time distortion measures the ratio between perceived time passed and actual time passed, and time distortion has been shown to be influenced by social media usage. It is important to understand how social media application design affects users' temporal experiences, and this study examines the impact of a visible clock on time distortion. We conducted a randomized between-group study where a control group (n = 3) used a social media application with a clock and a treatment group (n = 5) used the same social media application without a clock. Then, both groups completed a non-social media task to collect perceived and actual time passed. Initial results indicated that there was not a significant difference (p = 0.5711) in time distortion between the two groups in this sample. Both the control group (mean = 1.17, SD = 0.367) and the treatment group (mean = 1.02, SD = 0.289) presented slight upward time distortion. Additionally, we found that age was not significantly correlated with time distortion in this sample.
